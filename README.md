# Transformer Implementation with Multi-Head Attention  

### Overview  
This project implements a **Transformer model** with one encoder and one decoder, utilizing **multi-head attention** for sequence-to-sequence learning. The model is designed to process text data efficiently with **self-attention mechanisms** and **layer normalization**.  

### Features  
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Utilizes 8 attention heads for improved context understanding.  
- **Positional Encoding**: Incorporates positional information into token embeddings.
- **Layer Normalization**: Stabilizes training by maintaining zero mean and unit variance.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Enhances feature extraction through linear transformations. 
- **Encoder-Decoder Architecture**: mplements a Transformer model for text processing tasks. 

### Tools & Libraries  
- **Python, PyTorch, Transformers, NumPy**
